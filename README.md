# Calculator

**Goal**: Around the time that I started my freshman year in college, I realized just how little I remembered the math from my high school days. Therefore, I had the idea to manually code out the math for a multi-functional calculator that ranges from basic arithmatic to advanced calculus.
Because of my slow decrease in understanding even the most basic math operations, I gave myself a challenge: code a calculator using Python and manually do every single math operation using pure math to fully grasp the concepts. Some were simple enough such as arithmatic. Other like equation solvers were a bit more complex. The most difficult was concepts I never fully undertsood, but simply accepted, such as Trig. identities and hyperbolic function.
